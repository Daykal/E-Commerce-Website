 E-Commerce website to publish video games/applications, with Backend, Database and Frondend
Description
I am developing a full-stack E-Commerce website similar to Itch.io, Steam or Epic Games. Users will be able to register/login, browse video game pages, rate games, review games and simulate game purchases (no real transactions). 
I will handle both the backend and frontend development and the project is from scratch.
Tech Stack:
    • Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS 
    • Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Stripe  
Core Features:
    • API route handling, CRUD operation
    • User registration/login with authentication 
    • Secure shopping cart functionality 
    • Coupon code system 
    • Payment simulation using Stripe 
    • Sorting, pagination, and filtering of products 
    • Admin dashboard with product management 
    • Caching and optimization 
Challenges & Solutions
1. Learning New Technologies
    • Solution: Research, Google, and YouTube tutorials.
2. Scope Management (Over/Under Scoping)
    • Solution: Revise and refine the project scope as needed.
3. Feature Expansion
    • If time allows, I may integrate my personal video game project into this platform or add a comment section for users to review video games(Nice to have).
